  # Lesson 1: Introduction to HTML


  ## What is HTML?


  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web
  pages. It provides the structure of a webpage and is used to define elements
  such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.


  ## Basic Structure of an HTML Document


  An HTML document typically consists of the following basic structure:


  ```html

  <!DOCTYPE html>

  <html>

  <head>
      <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>

  <body>
      <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>

  </html>

  ```


  ### Explanation:


  * `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.

  * `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.

  * `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title.

  * `<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage, displayed in the browser's title
  bar.

  * `<body>`: Contains the content of the webpage, such as text, images, and
  links.


  ## Common HTML Tags


  Here are some commonly used HTML tags:


  * `<h1> to <h6>`: Headings, with `<h1>` being the largest and `<h6>` the
  smallest.

  * `<p>`: Paragraphs.

  * `<a>`: Anchors, used to create hyperlinks.

  * `<img>`: Images.

  * `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Unordered and ordered lists, and list items.

  ## Example: Creating a Simple Webpage


  Let's create a simple webpage using some of the tags mentioned above:


  ```html

  <!DOCTYPE html>

  <html>

  <head>
      <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
      <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
      <p>This is my first webpage using HTML.</p>
      <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
      <img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
      <ul>
          <li>Item 1</li>
          <li>Item 2</li>
          <li>Item 3</li>
      </ul>
  </body>

  </html>

  ```
